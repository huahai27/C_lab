[Problem description]

Write a program to read the numerator and denominator of a fraction from the console 
(the fraction is unsigned, and the numerator is smaller than the denominator, 
and its size will not exceed the representation range of the int data type), 
and output the fraction whose numerator and denominator do not contain a common divisor after simplification.

[Input format]

Input two positive integers from the console to represent the numerator and denominator respectively, 
and separate the two integers with a space.

[Output format]

Output the simplified numerator and denominator on the standard output, separated by a space.

[Input sample 1]

26664 479952

[Output sample 1]

1 18

[Sample 1 description]

The numerator input is 26664, the denominator is 479952, 
and the denominator can be divided by the numerator. 
The simplified numerator output is 1 and the denominator is 18.

[Input Sample 2]

9 24

[Output Sample 2]

3 8

[Sample 2 Description]

The input numerator is 9 and the denominator is 24. After simplification, 
the numerator and denominator are 3 and 8 respectively, 
without common divisors.

[Evaluation Criteria]

This question requires the output of the simplified numerator and denominator, 
and the submitted program file name is fraction.c.
