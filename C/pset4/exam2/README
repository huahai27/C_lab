[Problem description]

Write a program to replace a specified string in a line of English with another string and then output it. 
Note: When searching for a specified string, it is case-insensitive and may appear multiple times.

[Input format]

First, input two English strings from the standard input in separate lines 
(each string is not empty, the length does not exceed 20, and there are no spaces in the string), 
representing the replaced string and the replaced string respectively, 
and then input a line of English in the next line (the length does not exceed 200), 
with a carriage return at the end of the line.

[Output format]

Replace the input English with the specified string and output it to the standard output, with a carriage return at the end.

[Sample Input]

th
Hello
This second edition of "The C Programming Language" describes C as defined by the ANSI standard. 
Modern compilers already support most features of the standard.

[Sample Output]

Hellois second edition of "Helloe C Programming Language" describes C as defined by Helloe ANSI standard. 
Modern compilers already support most features of Helloe standard.

[Sample Description]

The string to be replaced in the sample is th. Since it is a case-insensitive search and replace, 
there are four substrings to be replaced in the next line of English information: Th, Th, th and th, 
which are replaced with Hello respectively, and the other information is output as is.

[Evaluation Criteria] 

This question requires programming to implement case-insensitive search and replace of the specified string, 
and the submitted program file name is exam2.c or exam2.cpp.
