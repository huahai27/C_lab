[Problem description] 

Write a program to implement the operation of adding two univariate polynomials.

[Input form] 

Read two lines of integers separated by spaces from the standard input. 
Each line represents a polynomial, and the coefficients of each term in the polynomial are 0 or positive integers, 
and the highest power does not exceed 50. The representation method for the polynomial 
a^nx^n + a^(n-1)x^(n-1)+ … + a^1x^1 + a^0x^0 (n≤50) is as follows: a^n n a^(n-1) n-1 … a^1 1 a^0 0

That is, two adjacent integers represent the coefficient and exponent of a term in the expression respectively. 
Only terms with non-zero coefficients appear in the input.

[Output form] 

Output the operation result to the screen. 
Output the terms with non-zero coefficients in order of exponent from high to low, 
and output their coefficients and exponents each time, separated by a space. 
Output a space character at the end of the line, and require a line break at the end.

[Sample Input]

10

54 8 2 6 7 3 25 1 78 0

6

43 7 4 2 8 1

[Sample Output]

54 8 43 7 2 6 7 3 4 2 33 1 78 0 
(Numbers are separated by a space, and there is also a space at the end)

[Sample Description] 

The two lines of the input file represent the expressions

54x^8 + 2x^6 + 7x^3 + 25x + 78

43x^7 + 4x^2 + 8x

The sum is

54x^8 + 43x^7 + 2x^6 + 7x^3 + 4x^2 + 33x + 78

Note: When inputting, first enter the number of coefficients and the sum of the number of exponents of the polynomial, 
and then follow the "coefficients" in the next line. Input coefficients and exponents in the order of "Exponent":
