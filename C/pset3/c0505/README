[Problem description]

Write a program to find the longest common substring of the input strings s and t.

[Input format]

Read the strings s and t from the screen in lines. 
s and t are composed of any characters and their length does not exceed 50 characters. 
The input data ensures that there is only a unique longest common substring. 
If there is no common substring, print No Answer

[Output format]

Output the longest common substring of strings s and t on a separate line, and output a carriage return at the end.

Algorithm tips: Use an int type counter to record the current matching length, 
and use a character array to record the current matching substring. 
If there is a longer substring, replace it accordingly.

[Sample description]

Suppose the following content is input from the screen:
aabcdababce
12abcabcdace
Then the output content is:
abcda
