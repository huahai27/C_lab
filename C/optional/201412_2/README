For the following 4×4 matrix,
1 5 3 9
3 7 5 6
9 4 6 4
7 3 1 3
After performing a zigzag scan on it, a sequence of length 16 is obtained:
1 5 3 9 7 3 9 5 4 7 3 6 6 4 1 3
Please implement a zigzag scan program. Given an n×n matrix, output the result of a zigzag scan of this matrix.

[Input format]

The first line of input contains an integer n, indicating the size of the matrix.
Each line from the second to the n+1th line of input contains n positive integers separated by spaces, indicating the given matrix.

[Output format]

Output a line containing n×n integers separated by spaces, indicating the result of the input matrix after a zigzag scan.
