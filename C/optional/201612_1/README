[Problem description]

In an integer sequence a1, a2, …, an, if there is a number whose number of integers greater than it 
is equal to the number of integers less than it, then it is called the middle number. 
In a sequence, there may be multiple middle numbers with different subscripts, 
and the values ​​of these middle numbers are the same.
Given an integer sequence, please find the value of the middle number of this integer sequence.

[Input format]

The first line of input contains an integer n, which represents the number of numbers in the integer sequence.

The second line contains n positive integers, which represent a1, a2, …, an in turn.

[Output format]

If the middle number of the agreed sequence exists, output the value of the middle number, 
otherwise output -1 to indicate that there is no middle number.

[Sample input]

6

2 6 5 6 3 5

[Sample output]

5

[Sample description]

There are 2 numbers smaller than 5 and 2 numbers larger than 5.

[Sample Input]

4

3 4 6 7

[Sample Output]

-1

[Sample Explanation]

None of the 4 numbers in the sequence meets the definition of the middle number.
