[Problem description]

Find the "maximum point" of a two-dimensional integer array. 
The "maximum point" of a two-dimensional array is defined as: 
a number is the maximum value of the row and the maximum value of the column. 
Note: There may be multiple "maximum points" on a row or column.

[Input format]

Read the two-dimensional array from the console.

The first line only has two positive integers n and m (n, m <= 10) separated by spaces. 
n represents the number of rows of the two-dimensional array, 
and m represents the number of columns of the two-dimensional array.

Then enter the elements of the two-dimensional array on the subsequent n lines. 
Each line has m integers separated by several spaces, 
representing all the elements of the two-dimensional array on that line.

[Output format]

Output the "maximum point" of the two-dimensional array to the console, 
and output it in the order of row and column subscripts from small to large, one per line. 
First output the "maximum point" value, then output the corresponding number of rows and columns 
(rows and columns are counted from 1), separated by a space.

[Sample Input]

3 4

8 60 7 100

10 498 12 49

-71 132 4 85

[Sample Output]

100 1 4
498 2 2

[Sample Description]

A two-dimensional array with three rows and four columns is input. 
The element 100 in the first row and fourth column is the largest element in the first row and 
the largest element in the fourth column, so this element is the "maximum point". Output 100 1 4. 
Similarly, the element 498 in the second row and second column is also the largest element in the second row and 
the largest element in the second column, so this element is also the "maximum point". Output 498 2 2.

[Evaluation Criteria]

This question requires outputting all the "maximum points" of the two-dimensional array. There are 5 test points in total.
