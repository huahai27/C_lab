[Problem description]

A three-digit decimal integer is called a "Daffodil number" if the sum of the cubes of its three digits is equal to 
the value of this number. Write a program to calculate all the "Daffodil numbers" in a certain range.

[Input format]

Input two integers (separated by spaces) from the console, representing the lower limit m and upper limit n of the data range, 
respectively, and satisfying 0<=m<=n<=10000.

[Output format]

Output all the "Daffodil numbers" in the data range (including the upper and lower limits of the data) to the console, 
and display them in a row in ascending order, with spaces between the numbers. 
If there is no "Daffodil number" in the data range, output the string No Answer.

[Sample input 1]

50 370

[Sample output 1]

153 370

[Sample 1 description]

The lower limit of the input data range is 50 and the upper limit is 370. 
Since the Narcissus number is required to be a three-digit number, 
it is actually to find the Narcissus number between 100 and 370. 
Since 13 + 53 + 33 = 153, 33 + 73 + 03 = 370, the Narcissus numbers in this range are 153 and 370 
(including the upper limit 370).

[Sample Input 2]

110 150

[Sample Output 2]

No Answer

[Sample 2 Description]

The lower limit of the input data range is 110 and the upper limit is 150. 
Because there is no Narcissus number between the data range, the string No Answer is output.

[Evaluation Criteria]

This question requires the output of the Narcissus number within a certain data range, with a total of 5 test points.
