[Problem description]

Input two sets of integers from the standard input 
(each set does not exceed 20 integers, the elements in each set of integers are not repeated, 
and the integers are greater than or equal to 0), program to find the intersection of the two sets of integers, 
that is, the integers that appear in both sets of integers, and output them in ascending order. 
If the intersection is empty, nothing is output.

[Input format]

Enter two sets of integers on two lines, separate each integer with a space, and end with -1 as input.

[Output format]

Output the intersection of the two sets of integers in ascending order 
(separate each integer with a space, and the space after the last integer is optional).

[Sample Input]

5 105 0 4 32 8 7 9 60 -1
5 2 87 10 105 0 32 -1

[Sample Output]

0 5 32 105

[Sample Description]

The first group of integers has 9, namely 5 105 0 4 32 8 7 9 60, and the second group of integers has 7, 
namely 5 2 87 10 105 0 32. There are four integers that appear in both groups of integers. 
After sorting them in ascending order, the output result is 0 5 32 105.

[Evaluation Criteria] 

This question requires outputting the intersection of two groups of integers. There are 5 test points in total.
