[Problem description]

If a positive integer is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits, 
then the positive integer is called a factorial sum number. 
For example, the positive integer 145, 1!+4!+5! is equal to 145, so 145 is a factorial sum number. 
Enter a positive integer, calculate the sum of the factorials of its digits, 
and determine whether it is a factorial sum number. 
Note: The input positive integer and the sum of the factorials of its digits 
will not exceed the representation range of the int type, 
and the highest bit of the input positive integer is not 0.

[Input form]

Enter a positive integer from the console.

[Output form]

First output the input positive integer and a comma "," and then output the factorial addition form of the digits 
that make up the positive integer starting from the highest bit, then output the equal sign "=" 
and the sum of the factorials of the digits, 
and finally output the string "Yes" on the next line to indicate that the positive integer is a factorial sum number, 
otherwise output the string "No" to indicate that the positive integer is not a factorial sum number, 
and output the carriage return and line feed after outputting Yes or No. There are no spaces between all output characters.

[Input Sample 1]

145

[Output Sample 1]

145,1!+4!+5!=145
Yes

[Input Sample 2]

1400

[Output Sample 2]

1400,1!+4!+0!+0!=27
No

[Input Sample 3]

4

[Output Sample 3]

4,4!=24
No

[Sample Description]

The positive integer input in Sample 1 is 145, and the sum of the factorials of its digits is 145, so 145 is a factorial sum. 
The positive integer input in Sample 2 is 1400, and the sum of the factorials of its digits is 27, so 1400 is not a factorial sum. 
The positive integer input in Sample 3 is 4, and it has only one digit, and its factorial is 24, which is also not a factorial sum.

[Evaluation Criteria]

This question requires you to determine whether the input positive integer is a factorial sum. 
The program file name to be submitted is fact.c or fact.cpp.
