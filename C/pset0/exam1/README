[Problem description]

It is known that the approximate value of π can be calculated using the following formula. 
Given an approximate value e of π, use the following formula to find the approximate value π closest to e, 
and the number of iterations n (greater than or equal to 1).
π/2 = (2/1 x 2/3) x (4/3 x 4/5) x (6/5 x 6/7) x … x [2n/(2n-1)x2n/(2n+1)]

[Input format]

Enter the value of e (e is greater than 2.6666667 and less than 3.14159) from the console.

[Output format]

Output the approximate value π closest to e, and the number of iterations n 
(separated by a space, and 9 significant digits are required after the decimal point when outputting π).

[Sample Input 1]

3.1201

[Sample Output 1]

3.120149087 36

[Sample 1 Description]

The approximate value e of the input π is 3.1201. 
When n is 35, the calculated π value is 3.119547206, 
and the absolute value of the difference with the given e value is 0.000552794. 
When n is 36, the calculated π value is 3.120149087, 
and the absolute value of the difference with the given e value is 0.000049087. 
It can be seen that the π value obtained when n is 36 is closer to the given e value than when n is 35. 
And the π value obtained when n is 36 is already greater than the given e value. 
When n continues to increase, the obtained π value will increase. 
Therefore, the approximate value closest to e obtained by the above calculation formula is 3.120149087, 
and the corresponding number of iterations is 36.

[Sample Input 2]

3.11955

[Sample Output 2]

3.119547206 35

[Sample 2 Description]

The approximate value e of the input π is 3.11955. 
When n is 35, the calculated π value is 3.119547206, 
and the absolute value of the difference with the given e value is 0.000002794. 
When n is 36, the calculated π value is 3.120149087, 
and the absolute value of the difference with the given e value is 0.000599087. 
It can be seen that the π value obtained when n is 35 is closer to the given e value than when n is 36. 
And the π value obtained when n is 36 is already greater than the given e value. 
When n continues to increase, the obtained π value will increase. 
Therefore, the approximate value closest to e obtained by the above calculation formula is 3.119547206, 
and the corresponding number of iterations is 35.

Note:
To ensure the accuracy of calculation, please use double data type to save the calculation data.
