[Problem description]

The approximate calculation formula of sinx is as follows:

sinx = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ... + (-1)^(n-1)x^(2n-1)/(2n-1)!

Where x is radians and n is a positive integer. 
Write a program to calculate the approximate value of sinx based on the values ​​of x and n entered by the user 
using the above approximate calculation formula, and require the output result to retain 8 digits after the decimal point.

[Input format]

Input a decimal x (0<=x<=10) and an integer n (1<=n<=1000) from the console, separated by a space.

[Output format]

The console outputs the formula result: retain 8 digits after the decimal point.

[Sample Input 1]

0.5236 4

[Sample Output 1]

0.50000105

[Sample Input 2]

0.5236 50

[Sample Output 2]

0.50000106

[Sample Description]

When x is 0.5236 and n is 4, the approximate value of sinx is 0.50000105, with 8 decimal places. 
Similarly, when x is 0.5236 and n is 50, the approximate value of sinx is 0.50000106, with 8 decimal places.

Note: To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data, please use the double data type to save the calculation results.
