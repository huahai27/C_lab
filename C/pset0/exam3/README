[Problem description]

It is known that the approximate value of e^x can be calculated by the following formula:

e^x=1 + x/1! + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...... + x^n/n!
Given x and n, use the above formula to find the approximate value of e^x.

[Input form]

Input a decimal x and an integer n (n>=1) from the console, separated by a space.

[Output form]

Output the approximate value of ex to the console (retain 6 valid digits after the decimal point).

[Sample input]

7 27

[Sample output]

1096.633156

[Sample description]

The input x is 7, and the value of n is 27, that is: find the approximate value of e^7. 
The approximate value obtained by the above formula is: 1096.633156.

[Evaluation criteria]
